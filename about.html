      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="image/renesha.jpg" alt="Renesha Matthews" title="Renesha Matthews" width="500"/>
      <p>I am currently a graduate student at the University of Florida, attaining a Master of Arts in Mass Communication degree with a specialization in Web Design & Online Communication. I received my B.S. degree at The University of Alabama, where I studied Marketing and completed minor courses in Creative Media.</p>

      <p>Product design and development interests me because of the idea of building and designing products is intriguing, which is why I decided to pursue a career in Web Design/Development in order to create a product for the web. During my time in Graduate school, I have created a fully-functional website and graphic design projects. I have also conducted user research for a website and collaborated with classmates to make recommendations on how the website's user experience can improve.</p>

      <p>When I am not working on projects, I love to jam to some music, play videos games, read a book, or spend quality time with my family.</p>
